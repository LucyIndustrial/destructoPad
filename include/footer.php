<span class="tinyText">DestructoPad is an open source project allows you to create short text notes
(up to <?php //echo $dp->getOverheadSize; ?> bytes) and is designed to run over the TOR network as a hidden service.
These notes or "pads" are stored on the server using encryption (<?php ?>). As soon as you create the pad you'll be given a URL
which you can give to someone to read. As soon as they open the pad it is deleted from the server, and if pads aren't
read they expire in <?php ?>. All pads are automatically encoded as UTF-8, and are returned with a text/plain MIME type.</span>
